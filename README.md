# Calculator-using-flask
I'm excited to share that I've built my first mini-project using the Flask framework in Python! 🐍🔥

This project is a simple Flask-based calculator that performs four basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. It has a user-friendly interface where users can input values and get results instantly.

🔹 Tech Stack Used:
✅ Python!🐍
✅ Flask 
✅ HTML, CSS (for basic UI)🎨

This was a great hands-on experience in understanding Flask routing, request handling, and rendering templates. Excited to explore more!
